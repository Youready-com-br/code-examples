## Generic Approach to Fixing Compilation Errors in Incomplete Code Samples

When encountering incomplete or non-compiling code samples, the general process to achieve compilation involves:

1.  **Identify Compilation Errors:** The compiler output is the primary source of information. It will point to missing symbols, incorrect types, or structural issues.
2.  **Address Missing Class/Interface Definitions:**
    *   If the error indicates a missing class or interface, infer its structure from its usage in the existing code.
    *   Create minimal, package-protected definitions for these missing types. Include necessary fields and methods (even if empty) to satisfy the compiler.
    *   Consider using Java records for simple data carriers.
3.  **Resolve Missing Imports:**
    *   If the error points to unresolved symbols for standard library classes (e.g., `List`, `ArrayList`), add the appropriate `import` statements.
4.  **Correct Structural/Logical Errors:**
    *   Sometimes, compilation errors stem from incorrect code structure (e.g., misplaced braces, incorrect loop nesting).
    *   Analyze the intended logic and refactor the code to correct these structural issues, ensuring proper flow and scope.
5.  **Iterate and Refine:**
    *   Fixing one error might reveal others. Repeat the process until the code compiles without errors.

This generic approach allows for a systematic way to tackle various compilation issues in incomplete code.
